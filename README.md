A clone of the classic Battleship game.

### 1. Challenge Outline (academic standard: pass level detail: section required for pass) – 10%

- **a. Summary and review of the problem, overall proposed solution.**
- **b. UML style diagram illustrating initial overall solution (linked to 1a)**
- **c. Initial working plan, overall approach, development strategy and approach to quality (linked to 1a,  1b).** 
- **d. Analysis and decomposition of the overall problem into key ‘epic’ style tasks (linked to 1b, 1c).**
- **e. Initial object-oriented design ideas and planned phased breakdown into smaller tasks (linked to 1d).** 

### 2. Development (academic standard: merit level detail: section required for merit) – 15%

- **a. Adoption and use of ‘good’ standards (linked to 1a, 1b, 1c).** 
- **b. Phase 1 development: tasks, code review and changes (linked to 1d,1e).** 
- **c. ..repeated for each development phase.** 
- **d. Phase n development: tasks, code review and changes (linked to 1d,1e).** 
- **e. Ensuring quality through testing and resolving bugs (linked to 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b..2c).** 
- **f. Reflection on key design challenges, innovations and how they were solved (with examples).** 

### 3. Evaluation (academic standard: distinction level detail: section required for distinction) – 10% 

- **a. Analysis with embedded examples of key code refactoring, reuse, smells.** 
- **b. Implementation and effective use of ‘advanced’ programming principles (with examples).**
- **c. Features showcase and embedded innovations (with examples) - opportunity to ‘highlight’ best bits.**
- **d. Improved algorithms – research, design, implementation, and tested confirmation (with examples).** 
- **e. Reflective review, opportunities to improve and continued professional development.**
